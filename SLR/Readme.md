This folder contains a SLR done during this thesis. 

This SLR is composed of three steps: 
- Papers extraction 
- Filtering papers based on criteria satisfaction 
- Data extraction based on final set (corpus) of papers 

1. Papers extraction: 
- Papers are retrieved from ACM and IEEE libraries based on predefined queries. 
- Results of queries can be fined here: https://github.com/olexstet/Master_Thesis_SO/blob/main/SLR/Papers_Criteria_Satisfaction/References-Queries%20papers.pdf. This file contains references of retrieved papers from ACM and IEEE. 

2. Filtering papers based on criteria satisfaction
- All the data related to this steps can be found here: https://github.com/olexstet/Master_Thesis_SO/tree/main/SLR/Papers_Criteria_Satisfaction
- In SLR_Papers_General_Analysis can be found indivial analysis of each paper as well as critria satsifaction for each paper. 
- Step 1, 2, 3 and final (4th) contains benchmarks and their properties obtained from the papers analysis. (More about anylsis in manuscript) 
- Tools folder contains all the tools information obtained during the 1st step analysis for all papers. 

3. Data extraction final papers: https://github.com/olexstet/Master_Thesis_SO/tree/main/SLR/Data%20extraction%20final%20papers
- Contains data retrieved from the final set of papers. 
- In Data Extraction SLR Papers.docx can be found data retrieved for indiviual paper.
